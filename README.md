# Twitter-Airline-Sentiment-Analysis

Customer feedback is so important for improving the quality of the services for companies. Airline industries try to collect data through some questioners form, but these forms may consist of some incorrect data since it is timeconsuming and customers may not take it seriously, also it needs a lot of manpower to analyze these data. However, Twitter is a popular social media and more than 100 million people use Twitter, about one billion tweets, are tweeted daily. So, Twitter is a golden source for the airline industry to get feedback from their customers. Once the data is gathered from Twitter we have to clean the text of customers. In this paper, we go through 7 different methods and we compare different techniques[1]. The paper is organized as follows. In section 3 we talked about how we extract the dataset, in section 4 we explained how we clean and pre-process the data, in section 5 we briefly explained the method that we used, in section 6 we provided the results of our work and we compare them, in section 7 we bring the conclusion and finally we talked about the future work.
